# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design-
The CS 255 course, System Analysis and Design presented an opportunity for me to worked for a consulting company that designs systems for various clients. The DriverPass project that we were working on this term looks to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. The main requirements for this system were to ensure the site had the most updated training and policies that aligned with the local Division of Motor Vehicles. Other requirements included the ability for users/admins to schedule appointments for students with driving instructors, push notifications and be compatible with various platforms including mobile applications.  The overall outcome of my work delivered on expected results, and I was able to meet expectations in a timely manner. Some critical phases in the design include user interface, and adding the proper non-functional requirements as needed which would add to being user friendly. In person meetings with the client, or via video conference helps to understand the clientâ€™s needs and expectations for the project. These meetings a critical to implementing the vison the client wants and painting the picture for the project teams.  My approach was simple and logical, focusing on each step in the timeline an ensuring all requirements were fully throughout before beginning work each day.
